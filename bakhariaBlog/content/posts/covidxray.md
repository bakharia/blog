## Description
- Image classification of Chest X Rays in one of three classes: Normal, Viral Pneumonia, COVID-19. 
- Dataset from COVID-19 Radiography Dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database)
- Libraries used: Pytorch

## Summary:
- Image classification of Chest X Rays in one of three classes: Normal, Viral Pneumonia, COVID-19 using Tensorflow
- Normalized the image by converting them into black and white images from grayscale to improve the accuracy after setting a
threshold value to take care of stray white patches
- Obtained an error rate of 8 %
